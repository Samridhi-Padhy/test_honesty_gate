"""Runner that applies each of the 5 mutants to demo-repo and runs pytest.

For each mutant:
1. apply the mutation to demo-repo/src
2. run demo-repo/tests via subprocess (pytest)
3. record survived (tests still pass = bad) or caught (tests failed = good)
4. revert the mutation

Fail closed: if a mutation run exceeds its time budget, it is treated as a
hard failure rather than hanging. The default verdict on any unexpected
error is ``fail``.
